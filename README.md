# Cybersecurity Risk Management & Business Continuity – Offshore Wind Farm Case Study

This repository contains my academic project for **INTE1002 – Digital Risk Management and Information Security (RMIT University)**.  
The project focused on **cybersecurity governance, risk analysis, and business continuity planning** for a fictional mid-sized company, **ABC Enterprises**, which transitioned from an onshore to an offshore wind farm.

## 📌 Project Scenario
ABC Enterprises (valued at $10 million AUD) moved its operations from land-based wind energy generation to an offshore (sea-based) wind farm **without sufficient cybersecurity controls in place**. This posed significant risks, including ransomware, malware, DDoS attacks, and TCP/IP hijacking.

As the consultant, my role was to:
- Research **cyber-attacks on renewable energy companies** globally (2012–2023).
- Provide **case studies (10+ incidents)** highlighting attack vectors, impacts, pre/post-attack measures, and lessons learned.
- Identify **top 5 risks** for ABC’s offshore wind farm.
- Recommend **security control strategies**, considering costs and budget constraints.
- Develop a **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** for responding to a severe cyber incident and data breach.

## 🛠️ Key Deliverables
- **Research Report (PDF/Word)** – Professional business report with case studies, risk assessments, controls, and recommendations.
- **Risk Tables** – Comparative tables analyzing attack types, impacts, mitigations, and ongoing vulnerabilities.
- **Business Continuity Plan** – Incident response, data recovery, legal compliance, and employee awareness strategy.

## 🔑 Skills Demonstrated
- Cybersecurity risk analysis & governance frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, Essential Eight).
- Research and reporting with professional standards (Harvard RMIT referencing).
- Business continuity & incident response planning (aligned with ACSC guidance).
- Risk mitigation strategies with cost–benefit analysis.
- Professional communication for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 🧩 Framework Alignment
This project demonstrates practical application of several industry frameworks:
- **ISO/IEC 27001 (ISMS):** Information security governance, risk treatment, and compliance alignment.  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Covered Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover lifecycle.  
- **ACSC Essential Eight:** Applied Australian cyber resilience strategies (patching, access control, backups).  
- **ISO 22301:** Developed a Business Continuity Plan (incident response, recovery, resilience).  
- **ISO 31000:** Risk management methodology used for likelihood, consequence, and control recommendations.
